Scripts directory.
Contains scripts for post processing or for parametric runs.

Please update the .gitignore file and add files to be ignored (simulation files).

*** IMPORTANT ***
As git does not allow negating specific files in an ignored directory, executables 
generated by Openmodelica will not be ignored. Either make a provision to explicitly 
rename the executable to end with a .exe (or something similar (add ignore rule)) or
delete the executable in the script itself.
