% MATLAB test scripts
% Using MATLAB with Modelica environments is difficult as there are numerous 
% tools. An easier and more efficient way is to simulate Modelica model and
% use the output mat file to run the post processing analysis.
%
% For now sticking with OpenModelica and Dymola.

% Testing three phase transformer

% model name
