Source files for Modelica documentation.
Modelica specification allows for a documentation section in the
'Annotations' section. The documentation should be in plain HTML.
Inclusion of images and mathematical formulae is allowed by referencing 
png or similar image files.

Easiest way to generate such a documentation is, create a documenation
file in any word processing software such as MS word or LibreOffice and
export the file as an HTML file.

To include the documentation in the intended Modelica model, simply
copy the generated source code from the HTML file and paste it in the 
Modelica model.

Images must be properly referenced. There is folder in the root of the 
library named 'Resources'. All the images must reside in there. 
The directory structure of the Resources folder must be the same as the
library. This would streamline the image referencing.
