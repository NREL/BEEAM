# Jupyter Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks to plot measured data and calculate and plot the validation results. The notebooks require data not included in the repository. These data have been made available via Google Drive:

1. Log into Google Drive
2. Access the data here: [BEEAM FLEXLAB Supporting Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v5ECGtDMT34KgVUHy1rZYJU19CBUWbbp?usp=sharing)
3. Right-click on the *BEEAM FLEXLAB Supporting Data* Google Drive folder and select `Add shortcut to Drive` to add to your My Drive

After these steps, when running the notebooks the contents of *BEEAM FLEXLAB Supporting Data* will be available under the mount point `/content/drive/My Drive/BEEAM FLEXLAB Supporting Data/`, as configured in the notebooks. If you use any other mount point for the supporting data, modify the notebooks within the *Setup* section to match the path you have chosen.
