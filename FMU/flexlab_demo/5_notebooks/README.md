# Jupyter Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks to plot measured data and calculate and plot the validation results. The notebooks require data not included in the repository. These data have been made available via Google Drive:

1. Log into Google Drive
2. Access the data here: [BEEAM FLEXLAB Supporting Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v5ECGtDMT34KgVUHy1rZYJU19CBUWbbp?usp=sharing)
3. Right-click on the *BEEAM FLEXLAB Supporting Data* Google Drive folder and choose "Add Shortcut to Drive"
4. Configure your Python environment to access Google Drive

After these steps, when running the notebooks the contents of *BEEAM FLEXLAB Supporting Data* will be available under the mount point `/content/drive/My Drive/BEEAM FLEXLAB Supporting Data/`, as configured in the notebooks by default. If you use any other mount point for the supporting data, modify the notebooks locally within the *Setup* section, under `# dir`, to match the path you have chosen.

**TO DO: The notebooks need to be updated to use data from `/content/drive/My Drive/BEEAM FLEXLAB Supporting Data/`. Data to be moved to that public folder and organized; notebooks to be updated.**
